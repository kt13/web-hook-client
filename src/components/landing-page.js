          <h2>Welcome!</h2>

          <p>This website is designed for people who are curious about the ingredients
            in the foods they consume. Each food-item search queries our user-contributed 
            database and <b>shows ingredients, allergen warnings, and user-submitted comments</b>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also uniquely designed toward people who deal 
            with the frustrations of the unknown that is day-to-day food 
            consumption at establishments as food allergy sufferers. 
            Those who suffer from food allergies donâ€™t know when another 
            reaction might occur at any meal and live in fear that each 
            meal - each bite - might have the potential to cause pain and 
            anguish. This website aims to aid in lifting the veil 
            between server and customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            An additional implemented feature is that of a nearby search 
            functionality for <b>pharmacies via zip code</b> for those who 
            discover that they have ingested a food allergen and seek 
            medicinal care.
